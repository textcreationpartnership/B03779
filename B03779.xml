         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe ſaid <hi>John Weir</hi> having in <hi>July</hi> 1690 given in a Petition to the Parliament repreſenting that in the late times there had been ſome Civil Action depending betwixt him and <hi>Gilkerſcleugh,</hi> whereby he was ſo ſtirred up againſt <hi>Newtoun,</hi> that during the Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi> threatned that if <hi>Newtoun</hi> would not deſiſt, he would inform ſuch words againſt <hi>Newtoun</hi> as ſhould be Treaſonable, condeſcending at the ſame time upon the Words, and that accordingly thereafter <hi>Newtoun</hi> was taken and made Priſoner in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and got an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to anſwer before the Juſtices for the ſaids Words, as alſo that he appeared as a Witneſs, and in the precognition deponed, conform to the Libel. But that the other Witneſſes, <hi>viz. Alexander Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie</hi> and <hi>Andrew symonton</hi> not proving ſufficiently, he was continued Priſoner till <hi>February</hi> 1686, that he was diſmiſſed upon a a Bill to the Council, and ſubſuming that the ſaid Proceſs and Impriſonment was occaſioned by <hi>Gilkerſcleughs</hi> malice againſt him, and that he was thereby put to the Expenſes of above 500 <hi>lib, sterling,</hi> and concluding againſt <hi>Gilkerſcleugh,</hi> and the other two Witneſſes that that may be decerned conjunctly and ſeverally to make payment of the ſaid Sum with the Annualrents thereof ſince the date and time of expending the ſamen, which having come to be called before the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of Fines and Forfeitures, and being debate and Probation taken: and all theſe Actions that was depending before the Committee of Fines and Forfaultures are now remitted to the Committee for Security of the Nation, that the Parties may be heard before them, <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi> before he make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular Anſwer to the foreſaid groundleſs and fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e the said <hi>John Weir</hi> one of his Curators, upon this Ground and Pretence that he was an Agent and Writer, and ſo could ſerve <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi> in any Affair that he had depending at Law, and he being allowed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tromet with the whole Rents of <hi>Gilkerſcleughs</hi> Eſtate, and others belonging to him, whereof to this hour <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi> could never get an Account, and albeit he will be Debitor to <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi> in great Sums of Money, as alſo the deceaſt <hi>Gilkerſcleugh,</hi> the Defenders Father being Cautioner for <hi>John Weir</hi> the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuers Father in Law to <hi>James Johnſtoun</hi> of <hi>Cariffen</hi> for a conſiderable Sum, whereof the Purſuer by his Contract of marriage betwixt him and his Wife, was obliged to make payment, and relieve the Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, in reſpect the ſaid <hi>John Weir</hi> had diſponed his Eſtate to the Purſuer, who married his eldeſt Daughter, yet ſo far was he from paying thereof, that he ſuffered <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi> his Pupills Eſtate to be appryſed for the ſame, the Legal whereof is now expired, through the Default and Fraud of the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuer, ſo that it is evident that the Purſuer will be Debitor to <hi>Gilkerscleugh</hi> in greater Sums than he is worth.</p>
            <p>This being premiſed, It is anſwered for <hi>Gilkerſcleugh.</hi> 1. That its not ſo much as alledged in the ſaid Lybel, that he meddled with any of <hi>Newtouns</hi> Eſtate, either as Fine of Forefaulture, or that he any other manner of way meddled with any thing that belonged to him, ſo that he not being able to lybel in the terms of the Act of Parliament anent Fines and Forefaultures, he has patch'd up the ſaids falſe and irrelevant Stories contirved by him, of purpoſe to force from <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi> a Diſcharge of the foreſaid juſt Debts, for which he knows he will be lyable: And whereas it is alledged that <hi>Gilkerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleugh</hi> was ſtirred up againſt him, upon the account of Civil Actions depending betwixt them, the ſame is groſsly calumnious, ſeing <hi>Newtoun</hi> had never any ground, nor did intend any Action againſt <hi>Gilkerſcleugh,</hi> but on the contrary he intented an Action againſt <hi>Newtoun</hi> to relieve him of the ſaid Debt, for which his Father was Cautioner, and which <hi>Newtoun</hi> by his Contract was bound to ſatisfie, as ſaid is, and he was ſo conſcious that the ſaid Purſuit was juſt, and that he will be lyable, that he was neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat to uſe a moſt diſingenuous Shift to ſtop the Proceſs, by debarring <hi>Gilkerscleugh</hi> with Horning: So that it was abſolutely falſe to pretend that he had any Proceſs againſt <hi>Gilkerſcleugh,</hi> which might have ſtirred up <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi> againſt him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the Libel as it is conceived were true, as it is moſt falſe, yet it is no ways relevant. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the words alledged to be informed by <hi>Gilkerſcleugh,</hi> are not lybelled as they ought to have been. 2. If the words had been lybelled, then they would either be Treaſonable or not, and if they were ſuch, then he was bound to have informed, otherways he himſelf would have been lyable in the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:178812:2"/>pain of Treaſon for concealing, or they were not Treaſonable, in which caſe <hi>Newtown</hi> would have ſuſtained no prejudice thereby. 3. It is notourly known, that there was previous Cognition taken by theſe who had Commiſſion through the whole Weſtern Shires, what one man knew againſt another, and obliged them to depone upon Oath, otherways they were ſent to Priſon; as alſo it was an ordinary Queſtion (whom ye do know that knows any thing of ſuch an Affair) ſo that as a perſon was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to tell who were <hi>Contestes,</hi> and one theſe Precognitions the Indictments at the Circuit Courts were taken out, and <hi>Newtowns</hi> Indictment conſiſts of many more Articles than theſe words alledged to be informed againſt him by <hi>Gilkerſcleugh,</hi> which were ſeparately relevant; and if the words had been treaſonable as <hi>Newtown</hi> pretends, then he was obliged to diſcover the ſame, eſpecially when he ſaw a ſevere Example before him of the Laird of <hi>Deuchall,</hi> who was forefault for Concealing only that which was whiſpered in his Ear by Sir <hi>John Cochran,</hi> who craved of him ſume Supply for the Earl of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Seing there was ſo univerſal a Precognition taken, as ſaid is, all that <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi> can pretend to have informed was the Words ſpoken to him by <hi>Newtown,</hi> and it is thought ſtrange how the dilating of theſe can be pretended to be the only ground of his Impriſonment, ſeing there is four or five ſeparat Articles in his Indictment, every one thereof was relevant to infer Treaſon, and which cannot be prtended that ever <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi> knew or informed of, becauſe <hi>Newtown</hi> was indited in <hi>June</hi> 1683 at the Circuit-Court, wherein it is ſpecially lybelled, <hi>that he ſent his Man and Horſe to</hi> Bothw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l, <hi>and that he took a ſham Inſtrument against his Servant at</hi> Lanerk, <hi>proteſting that he was innocent of his going, and that he only ſent his man to bring back the Horſe, but not to joyn with the Rebells,</hi> and that was the firſt thing that made him be taken notice of at <hi>Lanerk,</hi> and <hi>Gilkerſcleughs</hi> Depoſition is not taken till <hi>October</hi> 1683, which was after the Inditement, ſo that it is ridiculous to alledge that <hi>Newtowns</hi> Incarceration proceeded from <hi>Gilkerſcleugh,</hi> ſeing <hi>Newtown</hi> had been formerly Indited, and declared Fugitive for not appearing, and who upon his return and coming in was relaxed upon his taking the Teſt. 2. As <hi>Newtoun</hi> was relevantly Indited before <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi> was ex mined, as ſaid is, ſo it was groundleſs to pretend that any thing could be fixt againſt <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi> upon that account, ſeing by the Depoſitions adduced, it is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proven that <hi>Andrew Symontoun</hi> and <hi>Alexander Baillie</hi> ſaid that they would declare what would hang <hi>Newtoun,</hi> and that they would follow him to the Gallows.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As the Repreſentation made in the foreſaid Complaint, is Calumnious and Irrelevant, ſo it is againſt ſenſe to think that <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi> could have any Deſign to have <hi>Newtoun</hi> forfeit, becauſe <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun</hi> being Debitor to him in great Sums of Money: If <hi>Newtoun</hi> had been forefeit it would have rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Gilkerſcleugh.</hi> And further, to ſhew how abſolutely groundleſs the ſaid Lybel is, and how <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerſcleugh</hi> was againſt the forefeiting of <hi>Newtoun,</hi> that if need were he could prove by <hi>Littelegil Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Brown,</hi> who were Witneſſes in <hi>Newtoun</hi>'s Exculpation at that time, that <hi>Gilkerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleugh</hi> frequently ſaid to them, He could heartily wiſh, ſome means could be fallen upon to caſt him from being a Witneſs, which clarly demonſtrats that he had no deſign to get him forefeit. And the truth was, after he was liberate by taking the Teſt, all that befell him thereafter, was by his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, ſeing he, to ingratiat himſelf with the then Chancellor, he went and told ſeveral idle Stories a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Scots-men</hi> he had converſed with at <hi>London,</hi> and what their Deſign was, who did report the ſamen tot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Council, and who did immediatly order a Macer to carry him before them; and they finding that he prevaricat in his Examination, they thereupon immediatly ſent him to Priſon, where he continued till he was brought to a Tryal for the Crimes of Treaſon: And it is notourly known, how <hi>Newtoun</hi> has oppreſſed and abuſed the Countrey in ſeveral things, and of late he Committed a groſs Malverſe and breach of his Truſt, in ſo far as in the year 1686 or thereby, he being commiſſionat by the Duke of <hi>Hamilton</hi> to uplift ſome Reſts of the Tax<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion, he did groſly offer to defraud the Duke, and oppreſs the Countrey, which being repreſented to the Council, he was impriſoned and fined in 500 <hi>merks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. If there were any relevancy in the foreſaid Lybel, as there is not, for the Reaſons foreſaid, yet he cannot be lyable, becauſe he is ſecured by the Act of Indemnity in <hi>September</hi> 1688, by which, all Crimes, Offences, Delinquencies, and Tranſgreſſions of whatſoever nature or quality, committed, acted or done, by any one Subject to another, by Word, Write, or any other Act of Commiſſion or Omiſſion, which directly or indirectly may import by any inference or Conſtruction, the contravention of any Law, Act of Parliament, Cuſtom or Conſtitution of this Kingdom, or may infer any pain or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment againſt any of the Subjects, to the prejudice of their Lives, Fortunes, Eſtates or Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, either <hi>ad vindictam publicam vel privatam,</hi> either for Damnage or Intereſt, are Indemnified. And Diſcharges any of the Subjects to be called in queſtion for the ſamen, either Civily or Criminally: and Ordains that the ſaid General Indemnity ſhal be interpret in the moſt favourable and comprehenſive Senſe the ſame can admit of for ſecurity of the Subjects in the Premiſſes: and what is now lybelled againſt <hi>Gilkerſcleugh,</hi> if there were any relevancy or truth in the thing, as there is neither, the ſamen does clearly fall under the Act of Indemnity.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If ſuch a lybel as this ſhould be ſuſtained, it might be a ground of thouſands of Proceſs of that nature, for all Perſons that were contained in the <hi>Porteous Rolls,</hi> may upon as good, and better Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon raiſe ſuch Actions againſt the Witneſſes who were likewiſe Informers. So that if ſuch an Action ſhould be ſuſtained, it would be of a dangerous Preparative to the whole Nation. And it cannot be inſtanced that ever there was ſuch an Action purſued, far leſs ſuſtained.</p>

            <p>It was anſwered for <hi>Newtoun,</hi> that he had an Action of Poinding of the Ground, depending againſt <hi>Gilkerſcleugh,</hi> which was the occaſion that he was irritate againſt him, and albeit he was choſen one of <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi>'s Curators, yet he had no Intromiſſion except only with 700 <hi>lib.</hi> or thereby, and his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligement to relieve <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi> was only conditional, in caſe his Father in Law ſhould diſburden the Eſtate of other Debts which was not dene: And that it is ſufficiently proven by the Depoſitions of the Witneſſes, <hi>Gilkerſclugh</hi> to have informed Treaſon againſt <hi>Newtoun,</hi> and that it appears by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs againſt <hi>Newtoun,</hi> that the Advocat paſt from all the Lybel, except as to the Expreſſions informed by <hi>Gilkerſclugh,</hi> and the reaſon of his Impriſonment by the Council was, becauſe he would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form againſt <hi>Ceſnock</hi> and the other <hi>Scotſ-men</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> and the Reaſon why he was fined was, becauſe he allowed the Town of <hi>Linlithgow</hi> to make uſe of the Copy of a Suſpenſion as a Principal, and the Act of Indmnity does not meet this caſe, becauſe it could not take away any Parries privat Damnage and Intereſt, and by the Claim of Right, nothing in the late times ſhould be drawn in Conſequence.</p>
            <p>It is Replyed for <hi>Gilkerſclugh.</hi> 1. That he never knew any Action that <hi>Newtoun</hi> had, depending againſt him, neither does he inſtruct any ſuch Proceſs, and it is not like that he would have purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any ſuch Action againſt <hi>Gilkerſclugh,</hi> if there had been any Ground for it, as there is not, ſeing he knew that he was debitor to <hi>Gilkerſclugh</hi> in great Sums of Money.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is abſolutly falſe which <hi>Newtoun</hi> alledges, That albeit he was one of the Curators, yet he did not Intromet, except only with a ſmal Sum, ſeing it is notourly known in the whole Countrey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he was the ſole intrometting Curator, and uplifted the Rents during all the years of the Curatry, As alſo, he intrometted with, and diſpoſed of the Moveables, which was of a conſiderable Value: And the account of his Intromiſſions being drawn up, and allowance given of all his Payments, he will be yet reſting <hi>Gilkerſclugh</hi> above 30000 <hi>lib.</hi> So that it is evident, that all that <hi>Newtoun</hi> deſigns by his ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and calumnious Purſute, is only of purpoſe to frighten <hi>Gilkerſclugh</hi> from purſuing <hi>Newtoun</hi> for his juſts Debts, and to force him to ſome diſadvantagious Tranſaction: For the truth is <hi>Newtoun</hi> knows very well, and ſo is it known to all the Countrey about that he will be Debitor to <hi>Gilkerſclugh</hi> in more than all he is worth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As to that Pretence that <hi>Newton</hi> was only obliged to relieve <hi>Gilkerſcleughs</hi> Father of the Caution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, upon condition that <hi>Newtones</hi> Father in Law ſhould disburden the Eſtate of other Debts, this is like the reſt of <hi>Newtouns</hi> calumnious Alledgeances, for there is no ſuch condition in <hi>Newtouns</hi> Contract of Marriage; but he is expreſly obliged to relieve <hi>Gilkerſcleughs</hi> Father of the Cautionry, which will appear by the Contract it ſelf, if <hi>Newtoun</hi> would produce it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to what is alledged that <hi>Gilkerſcleaughs</hi> ſhould have informed Treaſon againſt <hi>Newtoun</hi> to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proven. It is Replyed. 1. That the former Anſwer is opponed, that it is no wayes Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to inform of matter of Treaſon, ſeing by the Laws of this and all other Nations, every man is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to inform againſt any perſon that is guilty of Treaſon: and if ſuch an Action as this ſhould be ſuſtained it would abſolutely hinder all perſons hereafter to inform matter of Treaſon, &amp; how prejudicial that might be to the King and the Nation: The Parliament may eaſily judge. 2. As it is not poſſible, that ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint can be ſuſtained to make any Man lyable for Damages without overturning the fundamental Laws of the Nation, ſo neither is the ſaid irrelevant Complent proven, for the Lybel reſolving in theſe two points, ſuch as the time of <hi>Newtouns</hi> Impriſonment, and the cauſe of it, that it was <hi>Gilkerſcleughs</hi> informing treaſonable Words againſt him, but ſo it is that none of theſe two Points are proven. For firſt, as to the time, it being alledged that he was two years and a half in priſon, the Witneſſes only declares that he entered to priſon in the year 1683, and that they ſaw him in Priſon in the year 1685, but does not mention the particular time they did ſee him in priſon, nor that he was in Priſon all the time. 2. As to the Cauſe of his Impriſonment, it is not proven againſt the Defender, neither can it be pretended that it was upon the account of any Information <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi> gave againſt him, ſeing <hi>Newtoun</hi> acknowledges by an Information ſigned under his Hand lying in Proceſs; That the oecaſion of his being put in Priſon was, that he refuſed to inform againſt <hi>Ceſſnock</hi> and other <hi>Scots</hi> Gentlemen at <hi>London,</hi> which clearly takes off all the conjectural Probation that <hi>Newtoun</hi> has Adduced againſt <hi>Gilkerſcleugh,</hi> as if the Caſe of his Impriſonment had been <hi>Gilkerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleugh</hi>'s Information againſt him. 3 Several of the Witneſſeſs aduced by <hi>Newtoun,</hi> and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>George Ogilvie</hi> declairs that he was ſent by <hi>Meldrum</hi> to the Tolbooth of <hi>Hamiltoun,</hi> to get In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation from <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi> againſt <hi>Newtoun</hi> by which it is evident that he did not give any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation till he was required by theſe Commiſſionat by the Government which is the very time libelled that <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi> ſhould have given the Information, and it being become Relevant by the Committie, and before the time libelled, or at the ſame time which is all one, <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi> was required to give Information by theſe who was Commiſſionat by the Government, relevant to Liberate him from this Groundleſs Perſuit, and this being Proven by the Purſuer's own witneſſes; <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerſcleugh</hi> ought to be Aſſoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>zied, even conform to the Terms of the Committies former Interlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutor. 4. The only Witneſs that <hi>Newtoun</hi> makes Uſe of, for proving that <hi>Gilkercleugh</hi> Informed Treaſonable Words againſt him are <hi>John Hamiltoun</hi> of <hi>Ellerſhaw</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Brown,</hi> and all that they Depon is, that they heard <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi> ſay, that if he did not get his own, and Right in an Affair that he had with <hi>Newtoun</hi> that he ſhould follow him to the Gallows, and if he got not him Hanged, he ſhould Stick him, which might have been ſome Words that <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi> ſaid in Paſſion, but there is nothing in theſe Words, or in all the Depoſitions in the Terms of the Libel, that <hi>Gilkerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleugh</hi> ſhould have Informed Treaſonable Words againſt <hi>Newtoun</hi> nor ſo much as that he did Inform againſt him; ſo that it is Impoſſible that ſuch a Probation can be ſuſtained to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:178812:3"/>make <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi> lyable for Damages if the Libel was otherways Relevant as it is not. 5. It is clear from the Depoſintions that the Perſons who Threatned to Inform againſt <hi>Newtoun,</hi> were <hi>Andrew Symintor</hi> and <hi>Alexander Baillie,</hi> ſo that as it is evident by the ſaid Probation, that any thing that was ſaid by <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi> was not any Treaſonable Words that <hi>Newtoun</hi> ſhould have ſpoken, nor that he Informed againſt him, ſo that it is clear by the ſaid Probation, that <hi>Syminton</hi> and <hi>Baillie</hi> were the Perſons that Threatned to Inform, and not <hi>Gilkerſcleugh.</hi> 6. As to <hi>Gilkercleugh's</hi> pretended Actual Informing; There is none of the Witneſſes Depones except <hi>George Ogilvie</hi> who was Clerk to <hi>Meldrum</hi>'s Commiſſion; and vvho Declares that he vvas ſent by <hi>Meldrum</hi> as ſaid is, only there is another named <hi>Alexander Ogilvie</hi> vvho is an Old blind ſottiſh Body, and vvhen he vvas firſt Examined, he vvas not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>xamined in preſence of the Partie, nor before the Commiſſion but in a Privat houſe, and albeit the firſt Depoſition ſeems to Concurr vvith <hi>George Ogilvie</hi> yet he thereafter Emitted a Declaration upon Soul and Conſcience, that he did never ſee <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi> in the Tolbooth of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> nor did know that <hi>Gilkerſcleugh</hi> gave any Information againſt <hi>Newtoun,</hi> only he heard <hi>George Ogilvie</hi> ſay ſo, which being but a Hear-ſay does not Prove, And albeit there were Concurring Teſtimonies as to that Particular yet it makes nothing againſt <hi>Gelkerſcleugh,</hi> ſeing any Information he gave, was given to theſe that had Commiſſion from the Government being required for that Effect, as appears by the Teſtimonies of the Witneſſes, which he deſires may be Read.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It was callumnious to alledge that the Cauſe of <hi>Newtoun's</hi> Impriſonment, and of being Fined by the Council, was only for holding a Coppy of a Suſpenſion for a Principal; it being noneſenſe to ſay that the Privy Council would Fine a man for ſuch a thing as that which is ordinary and that which is no Cryme, but the true Reaſon of his Impriſonment was becauſe he was endeavouring to Defraud the Duke of <hi>Hamiltoun</hi> and Oppreſs the Countrey, and Malverſe in his Truſt, he being Imployed by the Duke to Charge the Town of <hi>Lithgow,</hi> he took likeways Money from the Town and procured them a Suſpenſion againſt Duke <hi>Hamiltoun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The Act of Indemnity is opponed, which clearly meets this Caſe and has been many times ſuſtained both before the Lords of Seſſion and Juſticiary, for freeing Parties both from the Cryme and Damnage, and Intereſt, and the Claime of Right does no ways concern caſes of this Nature which can only be underſtood of Declarations, doings and Proceedings in the Late Government that were contrair to Law, But it was no ways contrair to Law for the King to give an Indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to His Subjects, for if that were Suſtained, then the Claim of Right might altogether take away the Act of Indemnity, and make it ineffectual which was never yet pretended, as alſo by the ſame Reaſon the Claim of Right might take away all Remiſſions given to any Party that had been grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe Fourty years by paſt, and what a Dangerous preparative that might be any man might eaſily judge, and ſeeing ſuch Acts of Indemnity has always been Suſtained in the ordinary Courts of Juſticiary to Free the Parties both <hi>quoad vindic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
